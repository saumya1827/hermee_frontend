Hermee The Label — Classic (Frontend)
===================================

What's included:
- React + Vite project (classic minimal design)
- Intro splash page with "Hermee The Label"
- Home page with hero and 5 outfit images (PNG placeholders)
- Virtual Try-On: upload photo, overlay outfit PNG, drag & scale overlay
- Cart & Sign In (stored in localStorage)
- Dark/Light theme toggle (persisted)
- Framer Motion basic animations included
- Tailwind config + deps are present if you want to enable Tailwind processing

How to run:
1. Unzip the project and open it in terminal/VS Code.
2. Make sure Node.js (>=18) and npm are installed.
3. Run:
   npm install
   npm run dev
4. Open the Vite URL (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- Outfit images are generated placeholder PNGs to keep the ZIP offline-ready.
- If you want real photos (photographic), provide images or allow me to fetch royalty-free photos and I'll replace them.
- Virtual Try-On works by overlaying PNGs; for best results use full-body photos with plain backgrounds.
- If you'd like Tailwind fully wired (so classes in styles will apply), run the Tailwind build or tell me and I can simplify CSS to plain classes.

Enjoy — tell me if you want photographic outfits added; I can fetch them if you allow web access.
